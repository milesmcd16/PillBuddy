<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
Pill Buddy is an app intended to help make medication management easier for two
types of users. Patient users that have to take medications and find it difficult to
remember to take them or for whom their medication taking schedule has become too
complicated for them to easily manage on their own and for caregiver users, any remote
friends and family that want or need to help them stay on schedule but can’t be there
physically.
To do this, Pill Buddy will allow patient accounts to have “buddies”, caregiver accounts
that are connected to the patient. Caregivers can not only see the patient’s calendars,
notifications, and the database of medications, but can also edit these things
themselves.
The major feature goals of Pill Buddy are to offer caregivers a confirmation system
where a caregiver can ensure that their buddy received their medication taking
reminders and did take their medication, the ability for caregiver users to send their
buddy further notifications in the event that one is being missed or ignored, and for a list
of emergency contacts to be maintained for the patient and for them to be contacted
through the app. The verification process involves the patient confirming that they saw
the notification and then sending their buddy video proof that their medication was
taken. The caregiver then verifies it was taken and the notifications can be cleared.
