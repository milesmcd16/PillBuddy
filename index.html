<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The Pill Buddy application is a reminder and confirmation application for those who need to<br /> 
take medications and have remote caregivers. This application will allow a caregiver user to <br /> 
link with other individuals so that they can send reminders and confirm that the individual <br /> 
who was to take their medication has seen the notification and taken it. The goal of Pill Buddy <br /> 
is to ease the burden on those who take care of individuals who may struggle with taking their <br /> 
medications on time, and to give them the ability to confirm medication usage of individuals from <br /> 
long distances. This document details progress made on the project through the creation of a prototype. <br /> 
This also includes feedback from users about the functionality and overall design of the application and <br /> 
how the team will respond to that feedback.</p>
