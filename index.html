<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
Pill Buddy is an app intended to help make medication management easier for two<br />
types of users. Patient users that have to take medications and find it difficult to<br />
remember to take them or for whom their medication taking schedule has become too<br />
complicated for them to easily manage on their own and for caregiver users, any remote<br />
friends and family that want or need to help them stay on schedule but can’t be there physically.<br /><br />
To do this, Pill Buddy will allow patient accounts to have “buddies”, caregiver accounts<br />
that are connected to the patient. Caregivers can not only see the patient’s calendars,<br />
notifications, and the database of medications, but can also edit these things themselves.<br /><br />
The major feature goals of Pill Buddy are to offer caregivers a confirmation system<br />
where a caregiver can ensure that their buddy received their medication taking<br />
reminders and did take their medication, the ability for caregiver users to send their<br />
buddy further notifications in the event that one is being missed or ignored, and for a list<br />
of emergency contacts to be maintained for the patient and for them to be contacted<br />
through the app. The verification process involves the patient confirming that they saw<br />
the notification and then sending their buddy video proof that their medication was<br />
taken. The caregiver then verifies it was taken and the notifications can be cleared.<br />
